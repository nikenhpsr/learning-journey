# My Learning Journal

## Introduction

Hello, I've been very interested in learning about Computer Science since elementary school. I'm not a CS Graduates but I have an extensive knowledge of Probability, Statistcal Mathematics, Calculus, etc. I think I will not have a problem in learning about CS. Here I will share some of the resources that I used and summary about I've learn so far.
