# Data Structures

Data in a computer program is organized using a data structure and data types. Data structures can have two main characteristics.

Firstly, they can be static or dynamic and secondly, they can be mutable or immutable.

- A **static** structure is fixed in size but a dynamic structure can grow or shrink.
    - An array is a static structure as its size is fixed.
    - A list is a dynamic structure as its size can increase or decrease.
- A **mutable** or changeable structure allows data to be edited, deleted or moved, but in an **immutable** structure data cannot be changed, it can only have more data added.
    - An array is a mutable structure as its contents can be edited, deleted or moved.
    - A string is an immutable structure as its contents cannot be changed without creating a new string.

**Arrays**

An array is a data structure that allows a programmer to organise data into groups of similar data. All the data in an array must be the same data type.

**Records**

Records are data structures that can hold data of different data type. A record data structure uses Field Names as the headers of each column. Each row is the data values for each record, in this example a single employee.

A record must have a key field, which is a unique identifier for that record.

# Data Types
A data type defines what sorts of values can be stored and how that data can be used. The main data types are:

**Integer**

Integer data can only store whole numbers - it will not store decimal places. The numbers can be positive (for example, 26) or negative (for example, -26) numbers.

**Boolean**

Boolean data can be in one of two states. Most commonly this is TRUE or FALSE, but it can also be 1 or 0, or YES or NO.

**Real/Float**

Real data stores numbers that allow decimal places, such as 5.3 or 12.0.

**Character**

A character data type allows only a single digit or character. This can include numbers, letters (both upper and lower case) and special symbols (eg Â£, &, @).

**String**

A string can contain one or more characters (eg Hello, ABC123).
